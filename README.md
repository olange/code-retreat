# Code retreats `GOTO :flow`

[![Chat on Slack](./.chat-on-slack.svg)](https://petit-atelier.slack.com/messages/CFYLHHC1G/)

Once in a while, we should retreat to study, practice, enjoy quiet time, meditate.
Get insights, get inspired, by the practice, by others amazing work.
Be honest. Step out of the frame. May be it is not that much about us.

Coding is very much about writing. Symbolic languages, natural languages.
Writing revolves around inspiration – or none, passing time, insights,
culture, knowledge and effort, rest, never ending practice.

And forget not taking a break, feed the fire to stay warm,
walk Caju the dog, breathe, and celebrate the happy times.
